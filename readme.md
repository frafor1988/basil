Basil

Basil is a free, open-source, responsive, minimalist WordPress theme that enables anyone to make awesome websites in minutes.

It's super-fast, SEO friendly and cool looking and it puts content over layout. 

Just upload wonderful pictures, fill in all the form when creating a page or a post and that's it!

No more over-crowded gold-over-plated websites around! Everything needs S P A C E !

Why Basil? Basil is FRESH, Basil is GOOD, Basil is COOL, Basil is NEAT, Basil is LEAN, Basil is LIGHT. Just like true italian basil!
