Basil
=====

Basil is a free, open-source, responsive, minimalist WordPress theme that enables anyone to make awesome websites in minutes.

It's super-fast, SEO friendly and cool looking and it puts content over layout. 

Just upload wonderful pictures, fill in all the form when creating a page or a post and that's it!

No more over-crowded gold-over-plated websites around! Everything needs S P A C E and S P E E D!

Why Basil? Basil is FRESH, Basil is GOOD, Basil is COOL, Basil is NEAT, Basil is LEAN, Basil is LIGHT. Just like true italian basil!

Shortcodes
----------

For now, Basil integrates only this shortcode:

### ACTIONBUTTON: useful Call To Action creator

The `[actionbutton]` is meant to create useful Call To Action in any kind of WYSIWYG editor within post or pages (or cpts).

It accepts several arguments:

`text` is the text to show before your Call To Action button, defaults to nonsense text

`label` is the label on the Call To Action button, defaults to nonsense label

`url` is the url to point to on click, defaults to `siteurl`

`target` whether to open url in `_self`, `_blank` or other accepted target values, defaults to `_self`

Example:

`[actionbutton text="Would you like to send an email?" label="Yeah, I really would!" url="http://etcetere.etce" target="_blank"]`

Upcoming features
-----------------

Basil is a full-featured theme already. However, there is always space for improvements!

* Homepage content slider for selected content (tag based or Custom Post Type based)
* Random backgrounds from [triangligy.js](https://github.com/qrohlf/trianglify) for post/pages without a featured image @qrohlf
* Custom Logo selection via the Customizer
* Custom Color selection via the Customizer

Hopefully, one day we'll see Basil in the official WordPress Theme repo. Still have work to do!
